# pyTikfollower
Python 3.7 script that automatically executes a custom task whenever you get a new TikTok follower.

## Usage
Enter your username in config.ini and wallah. By default it will just alert you when you get a new follower. To add a custom task to execute, simply edit the on_new_follow function.
I may add a few presets for this stuff in the future.

### Requirements
```
TikTokApi
```
Yup, that's it.
